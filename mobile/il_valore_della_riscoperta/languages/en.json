	"REDISCOVER-ROOM1-OLD-TEXT": "This room used to display a huge number of finds: showcases and cabinets were filled with amulets, paintings, and ruins. On the walls there were funerary stelae representing ritual offerings of food and drink to the deceased in the Afterlife. The many ushabtis bore evidence of the practice of placing figurines inscribed with prayers or autobiographical texts inside tombs and temples. One of the most important treasures of Turin's Egyptian Museum will be showcased in this room: the Tomb of Kha and Merit, a married couple from the 15th century BC. When the tomb was discovered, in 1906, it contained hundreds of objects that revealed many important details about the diet, fashion, pastimes, and rituals of Ancient Egypt's rich families.",
	"REDISCOVER-ROOM1-NEW-TITLE": "The new set-up",
	"REDISCOVER-ROOM1-NEW-TEXT": "The renovation brought to light large sections of the original “marmorino” plaster, as well as the light blue tone of the fine marbled finishing of the window recesses. On the walls a series of fine, painted medallions representing scientists and men of letters were uncovered, returning the hall to its original artistic splendor. The Tomb of Kha and Merit will be displayed in a striking new set-up, designed in collaboration with the Egyptian Museum's conservation specialists. It will include innovative glass showcases, allowing visitors to approach finds in a completely new way.",

	"REDISCOVER-ROOM2-OLD-TEXT": "Anthropomorphic, wooden sarcophagi – found by Ernesto Schiaparelli's Italian Archaeological Mission in the Valley of the Queens in 1903 – were displayed at the front of this room. They had belonged to the families of priests who lived in Thebes between the 11th and the 7th century BC. After the reopening, this room will be dedicated to finds from the site in Deir el-Medina, the village where the workers who built the tombs in the Valley of the Kings and Valley of the Queens in Thebes lived. The finds mostly date back to the New Kingdom period (c. 1550-1070 BC), and were found by the Italian Archaeological Mission led by Ernesto Schiaparelli in the early 1900s.",

	"REDISCOVER-ROOM2-NEW-TEXT": "The 19th-century medallions by the lunettes, with portraits of scientists and other illustrious academics, were restored. The new floors will be grés, chosen for its durability under heavy traffic, in colors coordinated with the rest of the New Egyptian Museum. Systems will be hidden underneath and the electrical outlets needed for the new glass showcases have been designed into the flooring.",

In the New Egyptian Museum, this space will be dedicated to the finds of the Tomb of Nefertari, discovered by Schiaparelli in the Valley of the Queens in 1904.",
	"REDISCOVER-ROOM3-NEW-TITLE": "The new set-up",
	"REDISCOVER-ROOM3-NEW-TEXT": "As with other rooms in the New Egyptian Museum, this space will be re-painted their original color – which was determined through accurate stratigraphic analyses on the walls and ceiling. This will be the only room in the New Egyptian Museum to recreate Schiaparelli's set-up. The old display cabinets will be used, giving the room the same look and feel it had in the early 1900s.",

	"REDISCOVER-ROOM4-OLD-TEXT": "Palazzo Accademia delle Scienze's second and third floor used to house the Sabauda Gallery, an extensive art collection that had belonged to the Savoy royal family. The whole space had been set up and organized to create what used to be considered the ideal environment to showcase art: sunlight was filtered, artificial lights were added, paintings had streamlined frames, and works were divided by period and school. The space that housed the Sabauda Gallery – until it was moved to Palazzo Reale in 2012 – will be used for temporary exhibitions and offices. From the oval balustrade visitors will enjoy a view of the space below, dedicated to the Middle Kingdom. An important set of grave goods will be brought together in a glass showcase right under the opening.",

	"REDISCOVER-ROOM4-NEW-TEXT": "Within the Egyptian Museum's renovation and renewal, some of the windows that had been covered or hidden were re-opened, according to the building's original design. The New Egyptian Museum will maintain the distinctive elements of the 1950s' set-up by Sanpaolesi, namely the oval opening in the floor, the glass balustrade, the red marble flooring, and the helicoid staircase connecting the second and third floor.",
